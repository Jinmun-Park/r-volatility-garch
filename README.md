<p align="justify">According to the table #, EGARCH(1,1) – Student’s t distribution, GJR-GRACH(1,1) – Skew student’s t distribution, EGARCH(1,1) – Student’s t distribution and GARCH(1,1) – Student’s t distribution were chosen as the best model according to information criteria for Corn, Palm, Rapeseed and Soybean series respectively. However, these models do not always perform the best for forecasting. This can be supported from the table above as we obtained different best models with different distributions for different forecast horizon according to out-of-sample forecasting performance using MAE and RMSE. Therefore, we are able to conclude that the distribution assumption plays a significant role in out-of-sample forecasting performance of return volatility of commodities. Normal distribution is the best dominant which provided the most accurate forecasting accuracy for all commodities and forecast horizon. </p>
